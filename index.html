        <h1>Learning Spaces for anyone, anywhere</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Meaningful education is rare anywhere, but in large parts of the under-developed world, there are kids who go to schools daily, usually at a great expense and end up learning very little. Simply because the teachers are either not competent, or not interested. Others deliberately keep real understanding for private tuitions. The result is rote learning and early drop outs from primary and high schools.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Within the same communities, there are (a few) passionate people who really want to help kids learn. But they don't have the direct means or the time to set up a private class, invite kids and teach them. A lot of young people are already investing a full time commitment to teaching (<a href="http://www.teachforall.org/">http://www.teachforall.org/</a>), but there are countless others who can't do it full time, but happy to give an hour or two teaching something they are confident about. </p>

<p>And if its something driven by the community, one person doesn't have to do it all. Someone can donate a space, another person can help with stationery etc, and someone willing to teach a bunch of kids can teach.</p>

<p>Of course it shouldn't be limited to teaching kids. May be an adult wants to learn a concept new to them, and help out with tutoring the rest of the class. </p>

<h2>What do I need?</h2>

<p>I am just proposing this so far, and made a mockup of what I had in mind (with a throwaway name):</p>

<p><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/679336/138405/f0cd14d6-71a1-11e2-8b55-b818bbb1fe28.jpg" alt="skoolink"></p>

<p>I can help with frontend development for the project, but my major contribution would be to get passionate people to signup from communities all over the world and register as teachers. I would need extensive help and support of a lot of talented folks like you. Project planning, scoping and management, toolsets, development, design and testing, everyone can help in one way or another. </p>

<h2>Thorny issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>How would a 10 year old girl living in the foothills of Mt Kilimanjaro know about this project, or even have internet access at all? I don't have a straight answer to this, but I can say this: If an area has a teacher registered on the site, they can find a way to spread the word and let parents or kids themselves know. Plus, internet access is not a critical aspect of this project, as the teaching itself would take place in the physical world. Also, there are countless places/ communities where internet access is available, and reaching out to the them is far easier.</p></li>
<li><p>How is it different from Meetup, where people often meet to learn something new? I think its very similar to meetup, but the audience is different, the motivation is different, and the outcomes are different too. You can figure out what the differences are.</p></li>
<li><p>So anyone can teach? Won't this create problems? From observation, private tuitions are taught by the most talented people in their favourite subjects, while they are often studying themselves at university/ elsewhere. They don't have a formal teaching qualification, but they are good at whatever they're teaching. That's why people pay them. If the same talented people are motivated to teach for free, I say we let them.</p></li>
<li><p>So people would teach for an hour and that's it? Well, it depends on the teacher, but if they can donate more time, we can let them create their own MOOCs (Massive open offline courses).   </p></li>
</ul><hr><p>Lets build this together, the payout in terms of someone understanding derivatives and someone else getting the satisfaction of teaching would be enormous on a daily basis.</p>
